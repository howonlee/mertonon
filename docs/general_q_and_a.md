# Q and A

## So how is this not going to create a terrible dystopian future where everything is grey and it's like _1984_ / _Brave New World_ / _We_ / _Brazil_ / _Black Mirror_ / _Manna_ / _Don't Create The Torment Nexus_ / whatever?

We are going into this with a basic sobriety about the nature of and difficulty of cost assignment. The thesis goes that the underlying problem is a sort of soft constraint satisfaction problem. The attack on the problem Mertonon comprises is differentiable nonlinear optimization with the chain rule and caching - this is called neural networks nowadays, or reverse-mode autodifferentiation. Any perusal of any economic history shows a thousand ways in which the problem of economic allocation is difficult.

But given the thesis, we do have a putative cause for the insanity, and given that we have a cause and a putative description of the fundamental problem stated numerically, the solution to the numerical problem suggests itself. [Here is a long and boring description of what we imagine the underlying problem to be](https://howonlee.github.io/2019/06/30/An-20Algorithmic-20Approach-20To-20Alienation.html). This we imagine to be an advantage of the formalization of the thing in a centralized system which is not directly money itself.

If you read the linked essay I already tried second order methods and found them wanting without subjecting anyone to a model with them. You can do that, if you have software! The default behavior of CSP people when encountering heavy tails is random restarts for a reason, I suppose, and an implementation is forthcoming eventually. That is, if _that_ works.

Heavy-tail stuff is well known in backtracking search land but an obscurity in neural net land, and peeps seem to find them in weight eigenspectra instead of in ordinary runtimes, and they seem to do it poorly, so if it goes onto the pile it goes onto the pile. The WalkSAT peeps also don't find it there, but there's cutoff issues with that stuff. We can go through this sort of simulation for a long time without subjecting any actual people to it, so Mertonon can have only relatively-proven technologies and stay working and failures can be detected in the lab and stay in the lab.

Mertonon comprises a technical attack on this problem of cost assignment within the scope of one organization. We anticipate material but mostly fixable failures. We also anticipate that there will also be material intransigent failures which persist for a long time. That does not necessarily mean that the new solution to the problem could not be materially better than the old solution, which is ultimately our bar.

And if problems occur (when problems occur) they can precisely be replicated, the scope of the failures limited, and fixes which can be shown in simulation to fix the putative problems issued by a third party (viz., Mertonon maintainers), which is more than you can say of some ideology that doesn't have software directly backing it.

You can read the entire source of Mertonon, including both the properly open source bits and proprietary bits (with the exception of the forthcoming licensing server, shop and cloud hosting), and that should ameliorate the overweening opaqueness implied in putative new systems of cost assignment, although individual instances of Mertonon might become more opaque as people issue settings and maybe make plugins and it's not easy going to read a codebase of any significant scope.

## You can't solve social problems with technology, though.

This is perhaps one of the only social problems which we really know is not unamenable to being solved by technical means in the present day. Money _is_ a technical means, and a technical subject, by which this problem of cost assignment is attacked in society. That solution has material failures, many of which are fixed in practice and many which remain intransigent after millennia of attack. We wish to attack some of the old-standing intransigent failures, but we are not blind to the difficulty of the task.

## Is this just some weirdo getting on the generative AI bandwagon?

Check the date on [this one](https://howonlee.github.io/2018/01/03/Your-20Market-20Can-27t-20Learn-20XOR.html). We just did nothing on that front until a bit ago.

## How is this not going to be like the social credit system of the People's Republic of China, specifically?

Well, we're not the government, first and most importantly.

Our understanding of how the PRC social credit system works is that there's a business-to-business portion and a population control portion. The population control bit is scarier and therefore gets more air time but the actual main thrust of the program is mainly business-to-business, and the population control system is basically a bunch of optional, toothless pilot programs currently.

There is no central overall score in either of these, unlike FICO in the US - this is actually as opposed to the much, much more FICO-like private organization credit scores like Ant's Sesame Credit. There is a lot of individual municipal weird pilot stuff that happens but this appears to us to be basically grantsmanship and weirdoes doing one-off things, like the Rongcheng littering program. These have mostly been walked back in material ways, like in Rongcheng itself and Wenzhou.

Our basic model of the business part of the social credit system is that the main thing that the Chinese system attempts to save is businessmen's livers. That is, in the late 90's PRC contracts could not be materially trusted in any way shape or form and the only really material way to engender trust in business transactions was to go and drink American-fraternity-brother levels of baijiu together. Contractual enforcement was a joke, contractual sophistication was similarly a joke, the legal system was unreliable.

Our understanding of the current state of things in 2020s China is that, if there is rigorously and absolutely no political content (especially with respect to the usual things that get the government tetchy over there) to the legal question, no sensitive industries and no foreigners involved, that the courts are very often generally and basically suitable for dispute resolution. Businessmen's livers still get cirrhosis on the regular, but that's because of the general anomie of modern life leading people to get fraternity-brother drunk every week, instead of the the specific problem of having to get fraternity-brother drunk every week in order to reify contracts (and after the 2012 anti-corruption campaign, they do it on cheaper liquor). This, and something that comes pretty close to G2, Gartner and Forrester but for all industries and run by the government, is the business portion of the social credit system.

There is also almost no AI content in the social credit score, which often causes confusion: this is a human-only government program. Often people who are unfamiliar with it are confused when they encounter this fact, and the concomittant reluctance of the government bureaucracy that operationalizes the social credit system to automate themselves out of a job. This does not apply to Sesame Credit or the Wechat Pay Score, but Sesame Credit and the Wechat Pay Score are private products of Ant and Tencent respectively.

Mertonon does not care about what happens outside of the organization, nor is it within the scope of Mertonon to judge the organization as a whole as object, not subject, like the business portion of the social credit system or like G2, Gartner, and Forrester. Mertonon is materially computationally enabled and there is a material computational portion of Mertonon's calculations. Mertonon has no opinion on whether you drink, how much, or what liquor.

## How is this not going to be like R. Dalio's Dot Collector app, used in Bridgewater and Coinbase, specifically?

The underlying cognitive basis of the Principles program seems to be on the organizational psychology of A. Grant, directed by Dalio. If there is to be an underlying cognitive basis of Mertonon, it would have to be on the connectionist school of thought that comprises the cognitive science counterpart to the computational successes of differentiable distributed representations.

(Although of course there is longstanding seething enmity between J. Schmidhuber and the PDP school of connectionist folks, there was also some factor of Schmidhuber going on and on and on and on on the mailing lists and Twitter and such about how neural representations are about credit allocation (as prelude for the arguments about academic credit allocation) for years and years that went into this.)

This necessarily entails more applied-math sophistication on our part. We imagine that Dalio himself has plenty of applied-math sophistication, but of the wrong kind: Itô calculus, not reverse-mode autodifferentiation, that sort of thing. This also entails more difficult UX and UI tasks and a different development scope.

Mertonon is open core, unlike Dalio's app, and even the proprietary sections are source available. Therefore we do not know if it also entails more software sophistication on our part. On the other hand, there is no differentiable distributed representation in the Dot Collector app, we can almost certainly guarantee you, despite not actually having the source.

There is a crisply defined underlying political and political-economic worldview under Dalio's app, which is basically total in scope and explained in several books. There is an incompatible crisply-defined underlying political and political-economic worldview under Mertonon, which is much more delimited in scope to the organization only.

## How is this not like FICO scores?

Mertonon weights and evaluations exist and have meaning only within the remit of the organization and should at this time certainly not be used for any loan issuance or anything to do with securities whatsoever, whereas FICO is certainly the standard for algorithmic decision-making on loan issuance. Specifically, with absolute clarity, Mertonon distributed representations cannot and should not be used to assess credit risk.

FICO score weights are arbitrary and fixed, whereas Mertonon weights can be learned. FICO scores are a creature of personal financial accounting, Mertonon distributed representations are a creature of cost accounting. As a creature of cost accounting, like the rest of cost accounting, to the best of our knowledge at the time of this writing Mertonon does not tread on heavily regulated ground, whereas the FICO score is justly regulated up to its eyeballs.

Despite the FICO score mattering a lot to people's personal finance, it is entirely closed source and has been for decades. Mertonon has material open source portions and almost the entirety of the rest is source available ("open core").

There is no affiliation in any way, shape or form between FICO, the corporation, (formerly Fair, Isaac and Company, also formerly Fair Isaac Corporation) and Mertonon except inasmuch as we do have FICO scores ourselves. Mertonon also has no affiliation in any way, shape or form to Equifax, Experian, TransUnion, PRBC, Sesame Credit, Wechat Pay Score, Callcredit, the Stichting BKR, SCHUFA, or any other credit scoring or rating system except inasmuch as we have scores that apply to us for some of these as ordinary people do.

## Can I use this for ordinary personal accounting?

It may be possible eventually, but development effort is mainly going to be directed towards managerial accounting for organizations and the needs of organizations, not for personal accounting. This will become far too complicated a system to be feasible or desired for that purpose, unless you have a staff of dozens and are an organization unto yourself.

## Can I use this for non-business, non-capitalist and anti-capitalist organization?

Yes. Instructions and feature attention forthcoming one of these days. However, Mertonon has its own underlying theory of value.

## I just want to shove increasingly (or decreasingly) abstract stuff in there.

Just do it and tell us about it, and we'll suck our teeth a lot and if enough people tell us that they're using it in some regular pattern we'll stick some features in there.

## Do Mertonon representations have to represent money?

No. Currently Mertonon has no direct conception of money in the first place. Instructions on how to do this without money and some feature attention coming one of these days.

## How are you going to get Mertonon to not be racist, sexist, bigoted, etc?

Direct incorporation of people into the model has this danger, but also its opportunities. We have many numerical ideas for attacking this problem specifically and for environmental-social-governance issues in general, but we have to do a lot of simulations, testing and tweaking before this is ready for prime-time. Years, not months. We have already tried some and unfortunately found them wanting.

There is no separate underlying Internet corpus or anything like that that Mertonon comes pre-trained with. All Mertonon training is done on data characteristic to the user's organization. Meaning, you won't come across open-corpus terrifying stuff unless you yourself put it there. However, all Mertonon training is done on data characteristic to the user's organization, so systematic underweighting of protected classes, etc will create bias against protected classes - but that is a (conscious or unconscious) action of the people determining weights.

To repeat, ultimately the global evaluation that Mertonon gives is a combination of local evaluations given directly by people, so in the spirit of the principle of _garbage in, garbage out_, this also requires the people in the organization to make judgments which are not racist, sexist, bigoted, etc. This is the request that the organization must make to the end-users of Mertonon as stopgap before more sophisticated tools are put into play (and after).

## How is this better than LV Kantorovich's suggestions in _The Best Uses of Economic Resources_?

Kantorovich suggested a vast linear program to replace Gosplan synchronously by way of shadow prices. This apparatus has something close to shadow prices but is backed by a differentiable algorithm: these are significantly more durable than linear programs to the vagaries of poor data entry and the stochastic nature of life. The nonlinearity also helps the modelling power immensely, and we think that nonlinearity and the spectral conditioning stuff neural net people do a viable attack to Kantorovich's noted problem of the massive connectivity of labor in the induced linear program graph.

On the other hand, Mertonon's model is not amenable to an analytic solution, whereas Kantorovich's suggestion was almost certainly amenable. On the _other_ other hand, that analytic solution would in turn have had difficulty conforming to reality.

Moreover, initial usage will be in smaller organizations than a world-power nation-state, that's gotta make things easier for debugging. Kantorovich first suggested automated methods for Gosplan to JV Stalin, which would probably have made things even harder for debugging if Stalin received the letters.

There is also of course the fact that we have computers and the whole modern edifice of software and Internet and Kantorovich, in the main, did not.

## How is this better than AS Beer's Cybersyn project?

Hierarchical algedonic learning is a much less proven technology than linear programming and nonlinear differentiable optimization (neural nets). It's also made less progress in the decades that it's had than neural nets and linear programs. You could be all weird about it and argue definitionally about how it's all hierarchical algedonic anyways, but the empirical academic schools never talked extensively to each other, as far as we can tell.

This is compounded by the fact that we have computers and Beer had a hell of a time getting them. Also, Howon is a US citizen and it would be considerably more difficult for the specific physical security difficulties the Cybersyn project had to be replicated in Mertonon's case. Also, we don't care about nice Star Trek chairs and we can get our whiskey in ordinary markets, as opposed to Beer, who took much of his payment in fine whiskey.

## How is this different than the perfectly ordinary operations research that modern people do in vast logistics-based organizations like Walmart or Amazon or the US Army?

People are only an adjunct (in the ordinary English sense, not the mathematical sense) in the large mixed-integer programs, assignment problems, network optimizations, allocations, etc that people solve for operations-researchy tasks in bureaus and companies everywhere. People are center stage in Mertonon's remit: this is a model of an organization's people above that of any other thing about an organization, so we will have some decent answers to the many difficulties of cost assignment for _people_ and deal with them in a way that becomes difficult for, say, some ERP or someone flitting around with a mixed-integer optimizer.

Mertonon is also intended to be used without any special expertise and without huge amounts of parameter-fitting-by-people-who-know-what-they're-doing, so Mertonon usage should be viable for organizations without huge amounts of technical expertise and specialized operations research-related knowledge. It is the full intent of Mertonon that you shouldn't need PHD's to operate it, which you can't say for what Amazon and Walmart have. A (very) eventual goal is for poor-literacy and no-literacy usage, as well as poor-numeracy and no-numeracy usage. An obvious followon implication is that the politics- internal, external, corporate-bureaucratic, general-organizational, systematic-ideological, interest-driven realpolitik, impersonal, personalistic, bloodless, stark-raving-mad, -will be endless and we'll just have to deal with that.

## How is this different from just ordinary algorithmic mechanism design?

Many of the same notes apply from the previous question, but specifically, we wish to direct you to carefully compare the algorithms of Walrasian tâtonnement and linear perceptron learning. Of course people left behind the linear ansatz a long time in perceptron-land, so much of the theoretical backing of this can be seen as reimplementing the history of neural nets real fast under that regime of tâtonnement - ignoring the original auction-driven semantics of the algorithm because we have decided to ship for organizations, because convincing businesses to do things is a lot easier than convincing markets to do things.

Many economists do not really accept tâtonnement as a valid picture of things because the Sonenschein-Mantel-Debreu theorem proves that it doesn't have a unique stable equilibrium. However, basically nothing nontrivial in nonlinear perceptron learning reaches a unique stable equilibrium and yet the entire edifice of perceptron learning still exists and does things, so one cannot really value unique stable equilibria too much.

Of course AI points of view on economic problems are not new. V. Conitzer, T. Sandholm "Complexity of of Mechanism Design" is a good starting point (to trace out what cites it), Nisan et al have a textbook, but they are basically concentrated on markets and don't intend to create actual living, working apparatuses amenable to the endless politics and compliance of organizations with ease-of-use suitable for people with less-mathematically-inclined educations.

Also, the statistical-physics point of view is rare, just as it pretty much is in much of practical combinatorial optimization - it's the underlying point of view for random restarts and annealing, but once you have the description of the techniques it is often said as article of faith that you can forget the physics. We do not believe such a thing, because we think organizational heavy-tailed behavior is quite analogous to the known Gomes et al heavy-tailed stuff, and the origin of that is definitely the statistical physics. There are of course economists who actually would know a renormalization group if it hit them in the face - Mandelbrot moonlighted as an economist for years - but they don't talk to those mechanism-design-economics people.

## Does Mertonon have anything to do with cryptocurrency or distributed autonomous organizations?

Absolutely not. Mertonon needs to be good-faith and centralized to work.

## What matter of political view does Mertonon embody?

> Suppose that a mythical visitor from Mars approaches the Earth from space, equipped with a telescope that reveals social structures. The firms reveal themselves, say, as solid green areas with faint interior contours marking out divisions and departments. Market transactions show as red lines connecting firms, forming a network in the spaces between them. Within firms (and perhaps even between them) the approaching visitor also sees pale blue lines, the lines of authority connecting bosses with various levels of workers. As our visitors looked more carefully at the scene beneath, it might see one of the green masses divide, as a firm divested itself of one of its divisions. Or it might see one green object gobble up another. At this distance, the departing golden parachutes would probably not be visible.

> No matter whether our visitor approached the United States or the Soviet Union [ed.: written 1991], urban China or the European Community, the greater part of the space below it would be within green areas, for almost all of the inhabitants would be employees, hence inside the firm boundaries. Organizations would be the dominant feature of the landscape. A message sent back home, describing the scene, would speak of “large green areas interconnected by red lines.” It would not likely speak of “a network of red lines connecting green spots.”

> HA Simon

The scale matters because our guess for what the problem is, is soft constraint-satisfaction. So, depending upon order parameter the problem varies very abruptly from the O(n) "happy fun times phase" (my term) to the O(2^n) phase they scare undergraduates with. And the menagerie of other phases, clustering, freezing, etc, which like 200 people on earth care about. Lots of this is claimed to not translate to the soft CSP regime. I don't think so, it's that showing it is hard - I have a currently unpublishable critique of Hoos and Stuetzle '99, for example. There is also what I like to think of as the undefined-problem regime, where neural nets and the other putative-soft-CSP methods have materially diverged and proving things in neural net regime is more miserable yet.

What happens outside the boundaries of the organization, Mertonon doesn't really care about at this time. We would welcome union users or government bureaus as easily as corporations, although we don't know as much about unions or bureaus.

All economic systems are basically dual to political systems. Mertonon will inevitably have an effect on internal and external political systems like any other economic thing does. We will reserve judgement on those political changes until we have some more examples of them.

## What manner of economic view does Mertonon embody?

There is a soft CSP-based economic theory of value to be written putatively underlying Mertonon which we had in mind during implementation. We will go write that when we write it. There are underlying putative causes of inequality and countermeasures of same, which will be described and then implemented, tested and thrown away if found ineffective, kept if found effective. There is a theory of class and measures to be taken with regards to same, including implementation, which we will also write.

All of them will be scoped to within a firm, construed as a world-in-itself, but it could be within the reader's remit to imagine a scaled implementation to very large firms or straightforward natural extensions to larger entities, because they will be reifications of pure-formal phenomena. We may or we may not implement those natural extensions.

If you want to tide yourself over while we write these documents, go read an econophysics textbook. We don't know of any good ones. Or you could read C Moore and S Mertens's strange comp-sci-for-physicists book, _The Nature of Computation_, I guess.

## Is this thing going to bullshit everything like LLMs (GPT, ChatGPT, etc) have a tendency to do?

There is no LLM in this system. Also, the system is simple enough that we're going to make attacks on model understanding available for the end user. However, the principle of _garbage in, garbage out_ still applies.

We will make eventual best efforts to have the entire operation of production Mertonon systems be deterministic, except inasmuch as entropy is needed for cryptography to work and for certain features which will be presented as nondeterministic straight up. There will be no LLM in this system for the foreseeable future.

## Why not closed source? Why make the innards public?

You're never going to get anybody to trust a system like this without them being able to inspect the whole thing. An important thing for anyone considering alternate and counter-implementations, by the way.

We welcome any and all good-faith third-party inspections and bug reports, and probably some in mediocre faith. Certainly we look forward to the jokes, memes and insults, mean-spirited or not. It could not be any other way.

## Why open core? Why not fully open source the whole thing?

This is basically a technology intended for vaguely normal-ish people to poke at. We (Howon) poked around at code for money at Metabase, where they had a convincing success at doing open core for vaguely normal-ish people. One of the important Metabase things that elevates MB against more fully OSS BI tools is a high-quality design, UX, UI team, really good docs and good business development. Those people need to be paid. There are software touchers who will do unpaid software dev for OSS but writers (good writers - Metabase has people who could and did get published for high-quality fiction writing) in practice will not write for OSS without money. Mere quantity of development and quantity of features also tells, which payment is important for, even for the software touchers.

Another fun phenomenon is that it's often easier to charge a certain type of corporation enterprise-software-deal money than to get them to use a FOSS product for free. This can be quite rational, justified by confidence in continuing support.

## How are you going to make money?

Dual licensing, cloud hosting, enterprise edition features in the non-open-source but source-available portion. Eventually. The tenant security issues with cloud hosting will be pretty dire if you, you know, remember competitive intelligence exists, so there will (eventually) be not only the on-prem option as in release but full-service we-do-it-in-a-colo-and-not-on-AWS hosting. If we ever get big enough we'll get our own DC's. For those who are less paranoid there will also be AWS cloud hosting. All are slated for a fairly long time from now except the enterprise edition features.

Notably, donations are not good enough, by 4-7 orders of magnitude, about. You cannot make serious paid software with donations, you need invoices. It is also sometimes easier to get some companies to pay 5, 6 figures for software than to give them software for free.

## Is this a perfectly objective measure of how much I'm worth?

No. It's the principled combination of how much everyone at the organization subjectively values you with respect to the organization and the prompt.

Economic systems are inevitably dual not only to systems of politics but also to systems of morality. We do not have a putative theory of morality dual to the economic theory at this time and will make no efforts in that direction for the foreseeable future. But "Everyone will readily agree that it is of the highest importance to know whether we are not duped by morality." ("On conviendra aisément qu’il importe au plus haut point de savoir si l’on n’est pas dupe de la morale.")

## I hate you personally and wish to do you symbolic harm.

Howon has a surprisingly auspicious birthday for burning effigies (November 5) so if you burn any effigies of Howon you should do it on November 5. Please share on social media or something. It would be pretty weird for me to give you instructions on how to burn effigies of me like with the dumpster fire prioritization thing, so you go ahead and figure that out yourself. Obey the laws of your jurisdiction, including burn bans, etc.

## What's with the pancakes?

Layers. Get it?
