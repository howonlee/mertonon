## Mertonon

Mertonon is a new way to plan and budget for organizations.

---

## Mertonon

With Mertonon, you make a picture of your org as a neural network.

---

## Mertonon

You do this by going on Mertonon and linking together local, political, human judgements of impact with respect to KPI's.

---

## Mertonon

Then, Mertonon itself will suggest changes to your budget based upon those judgements.

If you know about Project Cybersyn / Synco, this is an attempted modern version for capitalist or noncapitalist use by ordinary folks.

##### Some examples of things you could say if you had a Mertonon instance

"There's the Widgets department and the Doohickey department. We have found ourselves siloed badly. Doohickey people need to do things so Widget people can become unblocked. Mertonon says we need to bury our ill will for the overall good of the company (or: Mertonon says we need to figure out a way to be less dependent upon one another). Will you do this?"

##### Some examples of things you could say if you had a Mertonon instance

"We aren't really a cost center, even though we're evidently not a profit center. We're a hidden center, or an indirect profit center. Here it is, laid out on the Mertonon instance. We're integral to the working of the Acme org, and they then deal with the Apogee people who then deal with sales. So you see how we're essential to the profit flow of the org here."

##### Some examples of things you could say if you had a Mertonon instance

"Look, Beep-Booper #22's really seem like some random minor doodad, but the quality advantage we have for them is vital to our org's success and the whole department knows it. Here it is on Mertonon. So cost-cutting is probably a bad idea. You'll probably make enemies of Cobb, Dobbs and Hobb specifically if you cut it hard without their consent - see here. Not easy to see at first glance, eh?"
