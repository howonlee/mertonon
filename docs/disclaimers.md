## Disclaimers

Mertonon is postprealpha software. There are material known and unknown issues. Vast numbers of essential features are missing. Development is in an ongoing state.

Things Mertonon cannot (yet) do:

- Cure or prevent Murphy's law.
- Cure or prevent Parkinson's law.
- Magically avoid the principal-agent problem.
- Magically create accurate transaction data if people are fibbing or lying, especially systematically
- Magically avoid the Peter Principle, although I have some ideas.
- Magically avoid Goodhart's law, although I have even more ideas.
- There is no full double-entry accounting package for the whole firm yet.
- No allocation of BOM's, as of yet.
- Traditional operational research tasks like mixed integer programming for direct job allocations. It's coming one of these days.
- (There's also a long roadmap in /docs/ which you may want to peruse)

Because of the terms that the community edition of this software is licensed to you under the AGPL, there is nothing we can actually prevent you from doing with the software. All disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability from the AGPL apply. The below long list of disclaimers is to tell you where _you_ might get in trouble if you use the software in certain ways.

Mertonon is only and solely a managerial accounting tool at this time. Mertonon is not a financial accounting tool under GAAP, IFRS, HGB, PCG or any other standard (those standards mostly don't define what financial accounting tools are, but even if they did Mertonon would not be one). Mertonon is for internal use only, because Mertonon costing is not precisely absorption costing as required by GAAP for external reporting. Mertonon does not constitute an auditor's opinion or a SEC-compliant audit in any way, shape, or form. Mertonon is not an excuse for not following the laws of your jurisdiction, shirking any duties fiduciary or otherwise, or abandoning your moral backbone.

It is possible for Mertonon installations to be in compliance with Article 22 of GDPR, but this depends upon compliance efforts made by the organization making Mertonon-based decisions. Likewise, it is possible for Mertonon installations to be in compliance with the CCPA, the CPRA and the CPPA rulings, but this also depends upon compliance efforts made by the organization making Mertonon-based decisions. We will eventually make tooling to make compliance easier but the burden of compliance falls upon the organization making Mertonon-based decisions.

AI is under active regulatory attention in basically all significant jurisdictions at this time. Regulations are absolutely certain to move quickly in this domain.

There are unavoidable risks in business and in organizations generally. Use of Mertonon is not a guarantee of business or organization success. Mertonon attempts to make economic statements that are durable towards mild errors in data entry but cannot be durable towards serious errors in data entry and malicious attack. The definition of serious errors has been an active subject of research for decades and to the best of our knowledge people are fundamentally no closer to finding a crisp cutoff. Sufficiently effective bad-faith usage of Mertonon will break the system, like any other computing system.

Because of the nature of budgeting Mertonon must necessarily be political in nature eventually. However, we, the Mertonon devs, will not attainder or ennoble specific instances or any entity within those instances and we will not adjust or modify the general development or specific instances of Mertonon for internal political purposes, although you can configure your instance of Mertonon as you wish. We hand you the arena for the budget fight, but it must be you who spills the sweat and ink on the white sand.

Do not use Mertonon for any purpose with regards to securities ([as defined by the SEC](https://www.fdic.gov/regulations/laws/rules/8000-6200.html) and like organizations, and by the Howey test) or securities transactions at this time. There is significant up-front compliance which needs to be done for dealing with securities and we have not done it yet or prioritized it on the roadmap in any way yet. In fact, there is a material chance that we may never prioritize it on the roadmap unless forced to by people doing it, whereupon we will be angry at you. Specifically, Mertonon is not investment advice for securities of any kind. Do not use Mertonon for investment advice for securities. The actual financial alpha for the mere fact of trading with statistical models, including neural networks, has mostly been taken decades ago anyways.

Do not use Mertonon for insurance underwriting or other forms of formal regulated risk management. The developers of Mertonon are not an insurance firm and will probably never become one.

Mertonon is not credit scoring: do not use Mertonon for credit scoring, credit standing, creditworthiness or other credit-related purposes.

Follow all applicable transfer pricing rules and regulations while using Mertonon. We specifically do not claim that the transfer pricing-like method used by Mertonon has or does not have any interaction with IRS or other tax agency rules on transfer pricing, related parties, arms-length pricing or like concepts. Mertonon has no tax module at this time, do not use Mertonon to deal with your taxes or taxation in any way at this time. Do not commit tax evasion, with Mertonon or otherwise.

Use of Mertonon does not in any way, shape or form constitute the beginning of a fiduciary relation, an investment, legal or tax advisor relation, a broker-dealer relation, an independent auditor relation, or other such regulated legally-meaningful relation between any entity and you. We are not a firm that does managerial accounting directly, we make a managerial accounting tool. We do not have CMA's on staff and we recommend you go to another firm for CMA or direct managerial accounting services. We don't have CPA's on staff as of this time, either, if you really wanted to know.
