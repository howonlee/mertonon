## Why would you have something like Mertonon in the first place?

Imagine a corporate bureaucracy, vast and faceless, bustling with thousands and thousands of busy folks but two people in particular, Bob and Dobbs.

Bob is a salesperson who directly sells things to customers. Dobbs is a functionary doing something that's hard to understand for someone not slotted inside the bureaucracy.

At this point one can ask a question that a child could ask but is brutally difficult to answer: how much are Bob and Dobbs worth to the organization, anyways? How much money do they earn for the corporation?

It's less difficult to answer with folks like Bob - you could just count the value of product sold, multiply by some number or other. That's not the whole story, but it's a great big portion of the story.

But it seems much more difficult with folks like Dobbs.

Dobbs might work with some fellow named Cobbs, who in turn work with a programmer named Yobbs, who in turn talks to the salesperson Tobbs, but that's just one of a huge number of possible interactions that might impinge upon the actual direct contact with customers.

(Cobbs works with the manager Wobbs, who works with the salesperson Zobbs, Yobbs also works with the purchasing agent Pobbs who in turn works with two more purchasing agents, Gobbs and Lobbs, who go off and directly save money for the organization...)

Mertonon uses a modified neural network model to give an answer to that question for the case of folks like Dobbs, who are many levels of indirection removed from direct economic activity. It does so with certain material caveats and assumptions, but it also aims to provides a justification for the answer.

> A mythical visitor from Mars, not having been apprised of the centrality of markets and contracts, might find the new institutional economics rather astonishing. Suppose that it (the visitorâ€”I'll avoid the question of its sex) approaches the Earth from space, equipped with a telescope that reveals social structures. The firms reveal themselves, say, as solid green areas with faint interior contours marking out divisions and departments. Market transactions show as red lines connecting firms, forming a network in the spaces between them. Within firms (and perhaps even between them) the approaching visitor also sees pale blue lines, the lines of authority connecting bosses with various levels of workers. As our visitor looked more carefully at the scene beneath, it might see one of the green masses divide, as a firm divested itself of one of its divisions. Or it might see one green object gobble up another. At this distance, the departing golden parachutes would probably not be visible.

> No matter whether our visitor approached the United States or the Soviet Union, urban China or the European Community, the greater part of the space below it would be within the green areas, for almost all of the inhabitants would be employees, hence inside the firm boundaries. Organizations would be the dominant feature of the landscape. A message sent back home, describing the scene, would speak of "large green areas interconnected by red lines." It would not likely speak of "a network of red lines connecting green spots."
