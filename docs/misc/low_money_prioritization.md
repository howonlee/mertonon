# Mertonon Low Money Issue Prioritization

We recognize that people might not even have the small amount of money for the professional edition and still might want some prioritized features or bugfixes. However, free-for-all prioritization cannot be in good faith.

To reconcile those facts, we give a low-money but very-high-effort way to get prioritization of your feature. I hope that if you're a moneyed enterprise you might agree that you might want to just pay the money. To be absolutely clear, this is merely an option: the other option is to buy licenses and get prioritization without going through this rigamarole. This is for prioritization of features and bugfixes only. Buy the software if you want the professional edition or enterprise edition features.

We will also have a self-instance of Mertonon that we also use to do prioritization on, whenever we get the authn and authz to a decently working state, but we will always keep this method for those who do not want to deal with the self-instance.

## Materials

1. Cell phone. Presumably you have one already
2. Bunch of waste paper
3. Glue to make papier-mâché
4. Some way of making fire
5. Some place outside where you can make a fire
6. Fire extinguisher. You'd better have one already

## Instructions

Keep a fire extinguisher handy at all times. Do the burning outside in a non-flammable setting. If your jurisdiction has a no-burn notice, you should not do this. If there is permitting for burning, get a permit. If your jurisdiction has poor air quality, you should not do this. Generally, follow the laws of your jurisdiction.

1. Actually file the issue on Github.
2. Take some montage cellphone videos of you making a miniature papier-mâché dumpster about the size of a purse out of flammable materials. Quality of dumpster can be poor, this is not an art contest. Has to be papier-mâché. If you wish to stay anonymous, wear a mask or something.
3. After making the miniature dumpster, wait for it to be bone dry. Usually takes a day.
4. Write down the current date, "Mertonon" and the Github issue number of your feature request on a piece of paper.
5. Start recording cellphone video again.
6. Show the piece of paper with the current date and Github issue number and "Mertonon" in the video, making sure it can be read clearly in the video.
7. Crumple up the piece of paper.
8. Insert the piece of paper into the miniature dumpster.
9. Set the dumpster on fire.
10. Finish recording the video when the miniature dumpster is mostly ashes.
11. Edit the montage videos of you making the dumpster and the dumpster fire into one video. Gratis video editing is straightforward enough to find for a task of this simplicity.
12. Post a link to the video hosted on a public website as a reply to the issue you filed and add an @-mention. Gratis video hosting is straightforward enough to find.

After a valid video is posted, we will acknowledge and prioritize that feature request because you spent effort in good faith, even if you don't have much money. That said, programmers are feckless people and we are not exceptions, so just because we prioritize it may not mean that it actually gets done fast enough: we will only commit rigorously to deadlines for enterprise customers for consideration.

We may also just say no to the issue overall, hopefully before you go through this rigamarole, but we also reserve the right to do so after. This is not a method to dictate which issues we will fix to us, just a way to ask for prioritization.

You can ask to prioritize issues other people posted, if you feel like going through all that: just write their Github issue number on the piece of paper.

The video has to be in a public video host because we may share it, especially if it's entertaining. So be aware that the video may be shared.

If you cannot burn things, instead get some containers of water and take the video of you destroying the dumpster by soaking it in water and smooshing it with your hands instead.
