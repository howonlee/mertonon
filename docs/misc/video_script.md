Mertonon is a new tool for allocating resources in organizations. Mertonon is a neural network budget. We use neural networks to attribute revenue and costs to people and cost objects deep within your organization and suggest allocations, far from the sales and procurement orgs.

You could say, "We want a budget that allocates resources so that we make more or less profit", and have Mertonon calculate explanations and recommendations of changes to entire budget allocations, including internal cost nodes.

You could get evidence that your responsibility center is actually a hidden center, not a cost center, and therefore can be related indirectly to the overall profit of the organization.

You could, within a participative budget, give numbers to the executives with less effort, or be better informed about a traditional budget if you're the executive doing a traditional budget.

You could surface any surprises in how responsibility centers' owners view the organization and their position in it upfront.

Setup in 5 minutes, from a Java jar or Docker image. No GPU or ASIC needed. You can run it on your local machine, or on your own cloud instances. Cloud hosting is coming soon. Mertonon.
