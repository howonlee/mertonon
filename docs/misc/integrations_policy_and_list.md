# Integrations Policy

The Mertonon policy for integrations to other software is that we will integrate with anything and everything, proposed in good faith or bad, with the caveat of exception for organized crime, organized violence and partisan political organizations. The AGPL says you can _use_ Mertonon if you're one of those, it's just that we won't integrate with you if you're one of those.

That said, timelines for integrations will vary by 3-5 orders of magnitude (a week, a quarter-century...) and we will keep our own counsel with regards to ordering and timing, so really this is taking the problem of integrations las vegas-style instead of monte carlo-style. This is not the policy for other features but integrations we'll always accept.

Do not ask us if we will integrate this or that. We will integrate it, even if it does take us a quarter-century. Proprietary, OSS, don't care. SaaS, On-prem, don't care. Tech major main project, tiny single-weirdo thing, don't care. Directly pertinent ERP system, someone's IoT plumb-bob, don't care. Amazing documentation and great integration libraries, disgusting bullcrap I wouldn't accept from a high school intern, don't care. If that takes 100 years my successors will do it, if Mertonon remains a going concern. If there are rabid dogs guarding the vault with the only docs we will procrastinate merely a huge amount, then get a vaccine and an armored suit. We will never say no, although we will definitely delay and maybe curse your guts to our therapist and/or bartender if it's really terrible.

If we implement an integration it will be licensed AGPL or commercially by us. If you have less patience, want to keep your thing completely secret even from Mertonon or you are not inclined to have an integration licensed by the AGPL or proprietary to Mertonon, we will also have a manual for making integrations yourself eventually.

Just issue a Github issue telling us that you'll be adding whatever to the `to integrate` list below, we'll put it in as long as it's nonpartisan, noncriminal and nonviolent. We would appreciate it if you also included what part of the thing you'd like us to integrate.
