Small tasks roadmap ("I could colorably do this in one day only")
---

- Remove postgres requirement for build
- GH build CI
- GH test CI
- Logout BE test
- Exception handler that returns 400 instead of 500 if it eats something from validations
- Graph consonance test is being persnickety again, whack it until it stays still
- "Pathway towards AI and the executive" - turn outline into essay
- Cookie staleness gets nullpointerexception, make a less awful error
- More skeumorphism in button
- Some kind of middlingly durable settings db thing... maybe with table
- Use banlist for password
- Make sessions actually expire
- Avoid the denial-of-service possibility of the health check endpoint
- Stick in more shenanigans in the warmup request, yell about the mertonon user being given stuff
- Probabilistic semantics (follow Kolmogorov's first properly)
- Cobj deletion gotta cascade to weight, with affordance for undeletion implementation later - add this to generate too
- Figure out CLA / FLA / whatever we're going to use situation
- Weight thing in logspace (conform to fitt's), and with a value enter thing
- DB property: have a final\_state.sql that is propertied to agree with the migration list that is never used by migrations lol
- Multiplicative weight updating
- Whack the fiddliness of the transpositions by making uneven cobj cardinalities in generate
- Check for sign errors harder
- Attack flaky consonances
- Registry accuracy enforcement with tests
- Joined complex inserts for default cobj, weight, etc to avoid blank page problems
- Less half-assed logo
- Privacy policy
- Whack the intermittent group-by-dependent-uuid compilation problem
- Validation test properties... think them up. Not properties to validate, but properties to test the validation code. Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?
- SSL - JDBC conn to db w/ ssl - put in instructions and trivial config instead i guess
- SSL - serve with SSL
