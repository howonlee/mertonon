Small tasks roadmap ("I could colorably do this in one day only")
---

- Error screens
- Use banlist for password
- Probabilistic semantics (follow Kolmogorov's first properly)
- Cobj deletion gotta cascade to weight, with affordance for undeletion implementation later - add this to generate too
- Figure out CLA / FLA / whatever we're going to use situation
- Weight thing in logspace (conform to fitt's), and with a value enter thing
- Whack the gotta-double-click-for-weights problem
- Multiplicative weight updating
- Whack the fiddliness of the transpositions by making uneven cobj cardinalities in generate
- Check for sign errors harder
- Attack flaky consonances
- SSL - serve SSL from builtin server
- SSL - JDBC conn to db w/ ssl
- Dockerize so the nice video we paid for isnt a lie lol
- Joined complex inserts for default cobj, weight, etc to avoid blank page problems
- Less half-assed logo
- Vendorize fontawesome - this will make things airgappable, hopefully
- Privacy policy
- Whack the intermittent group-by-dependent-uuid compilation problem
- Validation test properties... think them up. Not properties to validate, but properties to test the validation code. Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?
