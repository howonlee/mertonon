Using Mertonon instead of Gantt Charts for Software Projects
---

- Gantt charts encode a structural point of view on power which is suited to industrial work. This is why software peeps hate them.
- This is because H. Gantt created them to organize industrial plants, in imitation of the organization of his father V. Gantt's slave plantation.
- White collar work is different because white collar workers are neither slaves, who have no political voice at all, nor industrial workers, who have voice by de facto or formal syndication in informal or formal labor union - they have political voice as individuals.
- Politics is at the core of the question of resource distribution in groups - it cannot be avoided and to avoid it is to fail at resource distribution. It can work so well that it becomes invisible, though.
- Therefore, even in formal structural planning of work, in white collar work, there must be political observance given to the voice of participants in the work - white collar work is differentiated in that the worker also participates in deciding what work to do and how to do it.
- This is particularly pronounced in software work because management often doesn't have observability in how to do software work at all, so developers often must be the whole arbiters of, or huge contributors on, how to do the work. Also with great influence on what work to do.

- This is an etic factor, a factor from the external point of view, in the Gantt chart, because of its roots in slave plantation tasking, but built-in to Mertonon.
- Deadlines in software are not a creature of time, but of political power.
- Political power is not a bad thing, but to enforce it upon people without also giving them a voice is not only unethical but foolish

- Here's how to use Mertonon, anyways. Direct encoding of constraint means that political power is also necessarily encoded in Mertonon.
- Contrast to how to do Gantt charts in software naively, tell you why it doesn't work
- Here's how to stuff that knowledge in a Gantt chart less naively. Why that doesn't work
- Here's what you do when you have political disagreements in Mertonon.
- Here's what you do when you have political agreements.
- Mertonon also suggests stuff to you, because Mertonon is a full backprop neural net.
