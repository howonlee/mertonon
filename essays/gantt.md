Using Mertonon instead of Gantt Charts for Software Projects
---

- Politics is at the core of the question of resource distribution in groups - it cannot be avoided and to avoid it is to fail at resource distribution. It can work so well that it becomes invisible, though - another failure and mistake.
- To never talk about power is to encode structures of resource allocation without ever being able to revise them. Even if it isn't really talk for polite company. Therefore excuse us for talking about power frankly.

- Gantt charts encode a structural point of view on power which is suited to industrial work. This is why software peeps hate them.
- This is because H. Gantt created them to organize industrial plants, in imitation of the organization of his father V. Gantt's slave plantation.
- White collar work is different because white collar workers are neither slaves, who have no political voice at all, nor industrial workers, who have voice by de facto or formal syndication in informal or formal labor union - they have political voice as individuals.

- Therefore, even in formal structural planning of work, in white collar work, there must be political observance given to the voice of participants in the work - white collar work is differentiated in that the individual worker also participates in deciding what work to do and how to do it.
- This is particularly pronounced in software work because management often doesn't have observability in how to do software work at all, so developers often must be the whole arbiters of, or huge contributors on, how to do the work. Also with great influence on what work to do.

- This is an etic factor, a factor from the external point of view, in the Gantt chart, because of its roots in slave plantation tasking, but built-in to Mertonon.
- Deadlines in software are not a creature of time, but of political power.
- Political power is not a bad thing, but to enforce it upon people without also giving them a voice is not only unethical but foolish

- What's a cost object in this situation? They're the individual tasks.
- What's an entry in this situation? The recordings of peeps actually expending effort on the tasks. Effort, more than hours - Mertonon will normalize.
- Weights? These are the dependencies peeps determine in the tasks, so this is the alternative to the Gantt DAG ordering.
- The difference is in the greater political mutability of Mertonon instances.
- When the weights mutate as they will because Mertonon will suggest new weights, these will indicate the structures of power and of dependency actually within the group of peeps doing the task
- This is what is meant by Mertonon giving political observance given to the voice of participants in the work
- Contrast to how to do Gantt charts in software naively - this doesn't work because it's an infliction of power on people who have serious power to resist, unlike slaves.

- We intend Mertonon instances to be places where you can store unseemly discussions of power and go back to work afterwards.
- Here's what you do when you have political disagreements.
- Here's what you do when you have political agreements.
- Mertonon also suggests stuff to you, because Mertonon is a full backprop neural net.
- We fully intend that this suggestion feature also work for the very specific quotidian purpose of looking good and blaming Mertonon for your failures. If you need a specific concrete person use Howon.
