Estimates and Doom - and our alternative to estimates
---

### lamo ai pic of gothic ass pictures or like press gangs

There is a grinding political doom that awaits many people who do things (individual contributors) in organizations. Here is the form of it. Management sits you down and asks,

"So what's your estimate for this task?"

If you're a callow youth, you give your offhand take. If you're not, you give a grimly-considered prognosis or start hemming and hawing or try to wriggle out of it like a worm caught in a bird's mouth.

Either way, that's not the doom that comes for you.

"7 weeks."

"So... 7 weeks. Why couldn't it be 5?"

Doom! Doom that comes for you no matter the fundamental methodology, no matter if it's story points or t-shirt sizes or work-breakdown or analogy. Doom that comes for you no matter how much actual data you have, little or lots. Doom that comes for you because of a fundamental worldview mismatch.

The managerial job is often one of negotiation. Managers are often trained in both negotiating and having a negotiating worldview whether in some MBA or by the school of hard knocks. It seems natural to the manager to negotiate budgets, whether monetary or temporal, because monetary budgets are often surprisingly arbitrary, so just throwing their weight around a bit can lead to better results for them and theirs.

The individual contributor, very often, has budgets both monetary and temporal forced upon them, but monetary budgets can be scrimped and saved for. Cutting scope and taking shortcuts is how one saves and scrimps for a temporal budget, but this is often not even allowed, especially cutting scope, and cutting scope is itself subject to negotiations.

## Q&A

### But Agile solves this problem in software in some way that I will now explain.

Did it? It's been 22 years. Agile is old enough to drink. And yet individual contributors still get asked for estimates daily. Agile is so vague that it cannot fail, it can only be failed. Therefore, you can't actually expect results out of it - it's the culmination of, a result of, good corporate politics, not a path towards undoing bad corporate politics. Woe betide the fool who adopts Scaled Agile Framework, a framework which I have seen exactly no decent software come out of!

### But it doesn't really seem compatible with our culture of not talking about this sort of thing.

We intend Mertonon instances to be places where you can store unseemly discussions of power and go back to work afterwards, if you're in the kind of culture where this sort of frank discussions of power and politics are unacceptable. Or it could not be, if you're not that kind of organizational culture.

### No, what I'm really here for is to have something to blame my failures on. Can Mertonon do this?

We also fully intend that Mertonon's suggestions also work for the very specific quotidian purpose of looking good and blaming someone else for your failures. A guide for that and countermeasures and counter-countermeasures and counter-counter-countermeasures is forthcoming whenever Mertonon allocates effort to it.
