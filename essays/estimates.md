The Doom in Estimates - and our alternative

There is a grinding political doom that awaits many people who do things (individual contributors - IC's) in organizations. Here is the form of it. Management sits you down and asks,

"So what's your estimate for this task?"

If you're a callow youth, you give your offhand take. If you're not, you give a grimly-considered prognosis or start hemming and hawing or try to wriggle out of it like a worm caught in a bird's mouth.

Either way, that's not the doom that comes for you.

"7 weeks."

"So... 7 weeks. Why couldn't it be 5?"

Doom!

Doom that comes for you no matter the fundamental methodology, no matter if it's story points or t-shirt sizes or work-breakdown or analogy. Doom that comes for you no matter how much actual data you have, little or lots. Doom that comes for you because of a fundamental worldview mismatch between the manager and the IC.

The managerial job is often one of negotiation. Managers are often trained in both negotiating and having a negotiating worldview whether in some MBA or by the school of hard knocks. It seems natural to the manager to negotiate budgets, whether monetary or temporal, because monetary budgets are often surprisingly arbitrary, so just throwing their weight around a bit can lead to better results for them and theirs.

The individual contributor, very often, has budgets both monetary and temporal forced upon them. Monetary budgets can be scrimped and saved for. Cutting scope and taking shortcuts is how one saves and scrimps for a temporal budget, but this is often not even allowed, especially cutting scope, and cutting scope is itself subject to negotiations.

There is another bad surprise: temporal budgets have significant internal structure. If a widget costs $10, to buy two widgets costs $20. To buy 10^5 widgets costs less per widget, but that cost curve is known and can also be quoted by the widget manufacturer. Not so for time budgets.

The fizzleblorp handler has to be extended so that it can handle wizzleblorps. That task is not a widget to buy: it's a compounded quantity. Does the new wizzleblorp solution conflict with the previous hammlebloop solution? What about the Blorp Ray emissions? We have a deadlock over whether we should go with the Moople Standard or the Woople standard that some of the senior IC's have been fighting about for two years. And we have to deal with the Tootle-Noodle Phenomenon.

This essay is one instance of a genre: there are a thousand essays decrying estimation in software and a relatively equal amount decrying estimation in other fields. The reason why the senior IC wriggles like a worm caught in the trap when asked for an estimate is because of that intermediate structure, which comes into their vision as innovation and uncertainty. The intermediate structure of things is always new - the screws are always the same, the wished-for product may be the same, but the screw-linkage-to-the-armature, the integration-between-Booper-and-Mooper, those are always new.

Unlike basically every other instance of that genre, though, we do have something to suggest to you that's not some hortation to organize yourself differently or to spend more time thinking about what-have-you.

Mertonon is a budgeting tool for quantities with politics, internal structure and intermediate structure, which we think can substantively replace the organizational purpose of estimates. It's intended for organizational budgeting first. Some autocracies led by individual contributors, like id Software under Carmack, manage to not give estimates by sheer dint of leadership will. Mertonon is for people without such ideological hardening.

### Put in a usage thing here but only 3 pics. I think real call to action, basically

### stakeholder things: show Mertonon instance to stakeholders.

### go-or-no-go-decisions: set up a Mertonon instance with everyone's input and stare at it hard.

There is often a moral-religious element to estimation, an enduring faith that the project is actually going to get done.

## Q&A

### But Agile solves this problem in software in some way that I will now explain.

Did it? It's been 22 years. Agile is old enough to drink. And yet individual contributors still get asked for estimates daily. Agile is so vague that it cannot fail, it can only be failed. Therefore, you can't actually expect results out of it - it's the culmination of, a result of, good corporate politics, not a path towards undoing bad corporate politics. Woe betide the fool who adopts Scaled Agile Framework, a framework which I have seen exactly no decent software come out of!

### No, what I'm really here for is to have something to blame my failures on. Can Mertonon do this?

We also fully intend that Mertonon's suggestions also work for the very specific quotidian purpose of looking good and blaming someone else for your failures. A guide for that and countermeasures and counter-countermeasures and counter-counter-countermeasures is forthcoming whenever Mertonon allocates effort to it.
