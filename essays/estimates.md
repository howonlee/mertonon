Estimates and Doom - and our alternative to estimates
---

### lamo ai pic of gothic ass pictures or like press gangs

There is a concrete, grinding, bureaucratic doom that awaits many people who do things (individual contributors) in organizations. Here is the form of it. Management sits you down and asks,

"So what's your estimate for this task?"

If you're a callow youth, you give your offhand take. If you're not, you give a grimly-considered prognosis or start hemming and hawing or try to wriggle out of it like a worm caught in a bird's mouth.

Either way, that's not the doom that comes for you.

"7 weeks."

"So... 7 weeks. Why couldn't it be 5?"

Doom!


## Q&A

### But it doesn't really seem compatible with our culture of not talking about this sort of thing.

We intend Mertonon instances to be places where you can store unseemly discussions of power and go back to work afterwards, if you're in the kind of culture where this sort of frank discussions of power and politics are unacceptable. Or it could not be, if you're not that kind of organizational culture.

### What are we going to talk about to the external stakeholders?

Often, schedules are for external stakeholders of some kind, as other budgets are. But they're not actually statements about putative base reality, so sharing partial Mertonon political pictures should be as mollifying.

### No, what I'm really here for is to have something to blame my failures on. Can Mertonon do this?

We also fully intend that Mertonon's suggestions also work for the very specific quotidian purpose of looking good and blaming someone else for your failures. A guide for that and countermeasures and counter-countermeasures and counter-counter-countermeasures is forthcoming whenever Mertonon allocates effort to it.
