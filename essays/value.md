# Towards a Pure-Computational Theory of Value

- Prices must be treated as ensemble
- Prices, taken as ensemble are a data structure
- Tantonnement, thus construed, are an algorithm on that data structure, therefore it's just gradient descent
- What is the formal problem this data structure is solving? Resource allocation
- Has to have the property of scale-freedom because peeps do futz with the scale non-marginally
- Like other instances of gradient descent, subject to the renormalization group

- Inequality from power law non-critical renormalization group. Instead of the scale-freedom coming from formal properties of criticality, it comes from formal upfront properties of prices
- Allocation is known to be NP-complete. These all have ordinary critical renormalization group semantics in discrete decision formulation
- Class because NP-complete problems are amenable to caching
