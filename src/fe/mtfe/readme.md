# Developing on Mertonon FE

1. Run the `yarn dev` command to get the BE server and autobuild for FE server up
2. Get the in-browser tests running with shadow-cljs, there's a yarn command for it
3. Go develop

If you're dealing with stuff that involves FE and BE at the same time, probably better to spin up a BE server and manually proc FE rebuilds, with `yarn fe-only`
