v0.0.commits - August 24 2023
----

- Initial release

v0.1.commits - August 31 2023
----

- Added a lot of backend stuff in preparation for adding user/password auth
- - Some migrations for user and separate user/password and session table
- - User model added
- - Login endpoint that will authn but doesn't have any actual authz linked to it yet
- Fixed frontend weight addition cost object nodes needing a second click
- h/t to M. Reinhard for finding a db spec problem on my end

v0.2.commits - September 7 2023
----

- Stared at the usage readme a lot and I'm not really satisfied with it. Multiple bad iterations

v0.3.commits - September 14 2023
----

- Dockerfile doesn't not exist anymore
- Authn and authz exists and works for backend iff you turn the feature flag :auth on. Not usable at this time. Utterly trivial authz only. Username-password authn only.
- Outlining the independent economic theory of value
- Futzing with the intro FE bit, which isn't done yet

v0.4.commits - September 21 2023
