A material part of Mertonon is open source but not open contribution. We plan to make material decisions for Mertonon contribution based upon the self-instance, but until we develop the tools to make that straightforward you'll have to contact us at oss at mertonon dot com or post on the github discussion forum to talk about contributing before you do it. We won't take drive-by contributions from those who haven't made themselves known to us.
